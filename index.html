    <p>
      Those who have met me have often described me as <em>bubbly</em>,
      <em>positive</em>, and <em>compassionate</em>. As a registered respiratory
      therapist, I take pride in providing the best possible care that I can to
      my patients. Whether it means seeing 30 patients during a 13-hour shift
      with no break, giving medication after medication, or drawing arterial
      blood gases every two hours, I strive to do my part as a member of my team
      and to do it exceptionally well. Part of working in healthcare is always
      staying abreast of the latest technology, ventilators, procedures, and
      medications. I hope to transfer my skills to the field of software
      development in order to continue to improve the lives of others. Attention
      to detail, commitment to serving others, great communication, and critical
      thinking skills prove valuable no matter where life takes us.

      I have many interests outside of learning to code, but my most favorite is
      working out. I love experiencing new gyms around town, using different
      equipment and learning various exercises. My ideal exercise involves using
      a barbell to perform
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwx6Ip7hd3I">Zercher squats</a>.
      Exercising is key for stress management.

      What I hope to achieve by attending DigitalCrafts 16-Week Full Stack
      Immersive Program, aside from gainful employment, is a sense of community.
      I truly enjoy working with others to solve complex problems. Itâ€™s always
      refreshing to hear different perspectives. I also hope to gain the
      technical skills required to become a great programmer. While a career
      change can seem quite daunting at times, I know that through discipline
      and perseverance, this journey will be a great one.
